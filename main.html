	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>My motivation to become a software developer stems from a deep-seated passion for technology and problem-solving. From a young age, I was fascinated by how software could transform ideas into reality and solve real-world problems. The ability to create something from nothing, to build applications that can impact lives, and to continuously learn and adapt in a rapidly evolving field excites me. Moreover, the collaborative nature of software development, where I can work with diverse teams to innovate and create meaningful solutions, drives my enthusiasm. Ultimately, I aspire to leverage my skills to contribute to advancements in technology and make a positive difference in the world.</p>
